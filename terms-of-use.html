						<p>
							ITLCT operates predominantly through digital means. The Atlanta,
							Georgia area is the official home for ITLCT. Our leaders are
							located in the United States between the states of Georgia and
							Florida and so we wish to acknowledge both locations.
						</p>

						<p>
							We acknowledge that ITLCT leaders reside on the traditional
							homelands and territories of Florida consisting of but not limited
							to the Seminole Nation and other first peoples such as the Calusa,
							Tobobaga, Timucua, Apalachee, Miccosukee, Mascogo, Taíno, amongst
							others. ITLCT also acknowledge that we operate, and our leaders
							also reside on the traditional homelands and territories of
							Georgia consisting of the Cherokee Nation and other first peoples
							such as but not limited to the Catawba, Muscogee (Creek),
							Chickasaw, Shawnee, Oconee, Apalachicola, Chatot, amongst others.
						</p>

						<p>
							The first peoples of Florida and Georgia who lived, worked,
							nurtured the land, and shared knowledge were involuntarily
							removed, faced difficult challenges and oppression, may still be
							seeking recognition and reconciliation in some cases, but today,
							they continue to shape their communities and the future in
							positive ways. ITLCT recognizes this and vows to be humble and
							respectful stewards of the lands, histories, and communities of
							Florida and Georgia's first people and other global tribes,
							nations, and communities as we engage in our work.
