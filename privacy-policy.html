					<p>
						ITLCT operates predominantly through digital means. The Atlanta,
						Georgia area is the official home for ITLCT. Our leaders are
						located in the United States between the states of Georgia and
						Florida and so we wish to acknowledge both locations.
					</p>

					<p>
						We acknowledge that ITLCT leaders reside on the traditional
						homelands and territories of Florida consisting of but not limited
						to the Seminole Nation and other first peoples such as the Calusa,
						Tobobaga, Timucua, Apalachee, Miccosukee, Mascogo, Taíno, amongst
						others. ITLCT also acknowledge that we operate, and our leaders
						also reside on the traditional homelands and territories of
						Georgia consisting of the Cherokee Nation and other first peoples
						such as but not limited to the Catawba, Muscogee (Creek),
						Chickasaw, Shawnee, Oconee, Apalachicola, Chatot, amongst others.
					</p>

					<p>
						The first peoples of Florida and Georgia who lived, worked,
						nurtured the land, and shared knowledge were involuntarily
						removed, faced difficult challenges and oppression, may still be
						seeking recognition and reconciliation in some cases, but today,
						they continue to shape their communities and the future in
						positive ways. ITLCT recognizes this and vows to be humble and
						respectful stewards of the lands, histories, and communities of
						Florida and Georgia's first people and other global tribes,
						nations, and communities as we engage in our work.
