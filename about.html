					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p>
						The land has a way of teaching us if we want to know, if we want to
						learn. "If These Lands Could Talk" started as an internal
						conversation that emerged during travel across traditional Diné (or
						Navajo) homelands in the summer of 2019. Driving through the
						red-pigmented and towering mountains and canyons, I couldn't help
						but to wonder what these lands would reveal if they had a voice. As
						I read through stories written by local indigenous people accounting
						lessons from the past and the impact that persists today - I learned
						that there are many gaps in education and what is taught in
						traditional education or found in textbooks. As a world traveler, I
						noticed parallels between these lands and other lands that I had the
						privilege to travel to throughout my life. Much of our world's
						history is passed down through generations, best and most accurately
						at times told through the people who inhabited the land for
						generations, and through the people who still nurture these lands
						today.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a sudden moment, the words just came out of my mouth, "If These
						Lands Could Talk, What Would They Say?" A question and statement all
						at once. I couldn't help but to wonder how many times have we
						traveled somewhere but are not aware of what peoples lived and
						cultivated the land or what structures they built to mold, shape, or
						even elevate the human condition as we know it today?
					</p>
					<p>
						Through these experiences, I realize how the past, present, and
						future are part of an overlapping continuum of human experience -
						like deep roots coming out of a mountain.

						<p>
							ITLCT operates predominantly through digital means. The Atlanta,
							Georgia area is the official home for ITLCT. Our leaders are
							located in the United States between the states of Georgia and
							Florida and so we wish to acknowledge both locations.
						</p>

						<p>
							We acknowledge that ITLCT leaders reside on the traditional
							homelands and territories of Florida consisting of but not limited
							to the Seminole Nation and other first peoples such as the Calusa,
							Tobobaga, Timucua, Apalachee, Miccosukee, Mascogo, Taíno, amongst
							others. ITLCT also acknowledge that we operate, and our leaders
							also reside on the traditional homelands and territories of
							Georgia consisting of the Cherokee Nation and other first peoples
							such as but not limited to the Catawba, Muscogee (Creek),
							Chickasaw, Shawnee, Oconee, Apalachicola, Chatot, amongst others.
						</p>

						<p>
							The first peoples of Florida and Georgia who lived, worked,
							nurtured the land, and shared knowledge were involuntarily
							removed, faced difficult challenges and oppression, may still be
							seeking recognition and reconciliation in some cases, but today,
							they continue to shape their communities and the future in
							positive ways. ITLCT recognizes this and vows to be humble and
							respectful stewards of the lands, histories, and communities of
							Florida and Georgia's first people and other global tribes,
							nations, and communities as we engage in our work.
